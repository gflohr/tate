# Outline

These notes intend to help people working on the checked-out sources.
These requirements do not apply when building from a distribution tarball.

# Getting Started

Just run `./bootstrap` from this directory.  You will need a couple of
common development tools or the script will fail.

Once everything is fine, you can run the well-known commands:

```
    ./configure
    make
    make install
```

You don't have to run "make install".  You can test the binary
`src/delete` after running "make" only.
