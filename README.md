# Tate

Tate is a chess engine implementing parts of the xboard protocol.

## Description

The software contains of two parts. The library "libchi" is meant to implement
all kinds of functions needed for chess engines in general. The actual program
"tate" implements the engine, evaluation function and so on.

## Strength

Tate probably plays on the level of FruityMax. Note that the last versions are
actually weaker than previous ones. I will investigate into it, when I have
time.

## History

Tate was written in November and December 2002 as an experiment. The original
repository was on a CVS server that is now lost. But I have created a minimal
git history by committing release files.
